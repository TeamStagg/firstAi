This will use a mutation ai to solve a simple platforming game
this is my first ai, dont yell at me
rad

how this brain gonna work

there are movesYEA

move example, 
move left for an amount of time
move right for an amout of time
insert jump
YEA

sooo ig for now just execute 20 moves than see who did the best

buthow decide moves

idfk let me think

ummmmmmm

i dont want this to be a b*tch array of moves ai, and i dont want to use a package

all right here me out, last time i tried this bing bong didnt have eyes, butttt
what if i show him the next platform x and y, in the middle of the platform
and each guy had certain tendencies and margins of error to different situations

for example when one guy sees the platfrom is right, they go right, with a margin of error of 20 %,
and onother guy sees a platform to the right and goes left,

the latter is a dumbass and will get weeded out

you get it
